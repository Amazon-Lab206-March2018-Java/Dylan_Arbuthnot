						<p>I have been interested in computers and how they work since I was very young. My first real experience with
						a computer was playing Pitfall II: Lost Caverns on a Commodore 64 that my parents brought home. That experience
						exploded not only my interest in video games but in computers and technology as a whole!</p>
						<br>
						<p>In addition to loving technology I also love animals! At home I have:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Two cats (Torpedo and Jean)</li>
							<li>A corn snake named Monty (haha!)</li>
							<li>An ornate uromastyx called Inky (like the Pac-Max ghost)</li>
							<li>An Autralian Kelpie named Maggie May (yes, after the Rod Stewart song, don't judge)</li>
							<li>And a Koi Betta that we decided to name Nathan Finnian (because Firefly, 'nuff said)</li>
